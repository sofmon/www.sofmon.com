      <h2>ABOUT</h2>

      <p>Sofmon was created on the belief that teams have immense potential to drive business success when they align
        their focus beyond mere technical tasks.</p>

      <p>Recognizing the tendency in the industry to narrowly prioritize technology, we see an opportunity to redefine
        success by turning routine tasks into commodities.</p>

      <p>At Sofmon, technology is leveraged as a strategic tool to fulfil our clients' ambitions, not as an end in
        itself. This pragmatic approach enables us to unlock new possibilities for our clients, freeing them to pursue
        their core
        mission with renewed focus and clarity.

      <h2>BUSINESS, DEVELOPMENT &amp; OPERATIONS</h2>

      <p>Cultivating a genuine BIZ/DEV/OPS culture is challenging. That's why our team excels at partnering with
        startups at the outset of their journey.</p>

      <p>By collaborating with your development teams, we demonstrate that the crucial knowledge they require extends
        beyond mere technical skillsâ€”it encompasses understanding the purpose behind those skills.</p>

      <p>Our approach begins with establishing deployment and testing procedures grounded in standard practices. This
        empowers your team to grasp, construct, test, deploy, and maintain the software they develop effectively.</p>

      <p>Our emphasis is on cloud deployments, ensuring we deliver value from the very first day.</p>

      <h2>ARCHITECTURE</h2>

      <p>Modern solutions can be complex without being unnecessarily complicated.</p>

      <p>At Sofmon, our expertise in service architecture enables you to craft solutions that are straightforward to
        comprehend and deploy.</p>

      <p>Our approach to service architecture stems directly from the BIZ/DEV/OPS culture. In this model, every business
        process is meticulously outlined, designed, and executed as an individual service.</p>

      <p>Such contemporary architecture permits a compact team to focus on developing new features, requiring
        modifications to existing services only when there are changes in the corresponding business processes.</p>

      <h2>BEHAVIOUR VERIFICATION</h2>

      <p>Testing your code is crucial; however, it evaluates the code itself, not the business process it aims to
        embody.</p>

      <p>Sofmon facilitates the initiation of behavior testing for your solutions through standardization and
        automation.</p>

      <p>Such automated behavior testing is integral to our methodology from the outset, laying the groundwork for the
        BIZ/DEV/OPS culture we foster and stands as one of our most valued offerings.</p>

      <p>Automated behavior testing is essential for enabling continuous deployment to production, allowing for multiple
        releases every day, starting from day one.</p>

        business challenges, or even stepping in as an interim tech lead.</p>
